## Project

The project consists in the implementation of the Streamlet consensus algorithm that can be used to
implement a distributed ledger. Such abstraction is sufficient for implementing blockchain or for replicating
services using the state machine approach.
The project requires the implementation of a local transaction generation module and a node library capable
of generating and ordering the blocks containing the transactions in a distributed way.
